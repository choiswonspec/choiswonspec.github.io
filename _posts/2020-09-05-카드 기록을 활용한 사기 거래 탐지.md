- 카드 기록을 활용한 사기 거래 탐지
- 대부분 컬럼이 비식별화 되어 있어, 데이터 탐색을 통한 데이터에 대한 이해가 매우 중요하다.

# 사용 데이터

#### train.csv: 모델 학습용 데이터(데이터가 커서 샘플링된 데이터 제공) / test.csv: 모델 평가용 데이터
- TransactionID: 거래 ID ( 비식별화 )
- TransactionDT: 거래 시각 ( 비식별화 )
- TransactionAmt: 거래 금액(US Dollar)
- ProductCD: 상품 코드
- card1 – card6: 카드 관련 정보(비식별화)
- P_emaildomain, R_emaildomain: 이메일 정보
- M1 – M9: 기존 거래와의 매칭 정보
- isFraud : 사기 거래 여부

#### 전체적으로 비식별화된 컬럼이 많고 결측치가 많으며 클래스 불균형 문제가 존재한다.


## 1. 데이터 불러오기 및 기본 설정


```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

```python
df.drop(['TransactionID', 'TransactionDT'], axis = 1, inplace = True) # 도메인 지식하에, 불필요한 변수라 판단하여 삭제
```

#### 1.2 데이터 분리

- df: sampled_train_transaction.csv
- 'TransactionID', 'TransactionDT’ 변수는 삭제
- X: df에서 isFraud가 제거된 데이터 프레임
- Y: df에서 isFraud값만 가져온 Series
- Train_X, Test_X, Train_Y, Test_Y



```python
X = df.drop(['isFraud'], axis = 1)
Y = df['isFraud']

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
Train_X, Test_X, Train_Y, Test_Y = train_test_split(X, Y)
```

## 2. 변수 탐색

#### 2.1 라벨 확인
- 사기 거래가 아닌 거래가 전체 거래의 97.4%를 차지
- 클래스 불균형 문제가 발생할 확률이 매우 높아보임

- Train_Y에 대해, value_counts 를 적용하여 라벨 분포 확인
- 클래스 불균형 문제가 발생할 확률이 매우 높아 보임


```python
Train_Y.value_counts(normalize = True)
```




    0    0.974187
    1    0.025813
    Name: isFraud, dtype: float64




```python
Train_Y.value_counts(normalize = False)
```




    0    73064
    1     1936
    Name: isFraud, dtype: int64



#### 2.2 변수별 상태 공간 확인: 컬럼별 유니크한 값 일부 확인
- Train_X에 포함된 모든 컬럼에 대해, 타입, 결측개수, 상태공간 크기, 상태 공간 일부를 확인
- 이를 바탕으로 결측이 포함된 변수와 그렇지 않은 변수, 연속형 변수와 범주형 변수를 구분


#### 탐색 내용
- TransactionAmt는 연속형 변수임이 확실해보임 (히스토그램 등으로 확인)
- ProductCD, card4, card6은 범주형 변수임이 확실해보임 (결측 포함)
- P_emaildomain, R_emaildomain은 구매자의 이메일 도메인으로 보임. 직관적으로 봤을 때, 유의한 의미가 있을지 의심되며, 둘은 관계가 있을 것으로 보임
- card1, card2, card3, card5은 연속형 변수임이 확실해보임 (히스토그램 등으로 확인)
- 많은 변수에서 결측이 포함되어 있음
- C3를 제외한 C1 ~ C14는 모두 연속형 변수인 것으로 보임. 비식별화되어 있어 대략적인 의미라도 추측을 해야 함
- 결측이 매우 많아, 곧바로 대체하기에는 부담이 있어, 결측 분포 확인 필요
- M1 ~ M9는 매칭 정보이며, 전부 범주형 변수임이 확실함. T는 매칭됨, F는 매칭되지 않음을 나타내는 것으로 보이며, 모두 결측이 포함


```python
for col in Train_X.columns:
    print("변수: {}, 타입: {}, 결측 개수: {}, 상태공간 크기: {}, 상태공간 일부: {}".format(col, Train_X[col].dtype, Train_X[col].isnull().sum(), len(Train_X[col].unique()), Train_X[col].unique()[:5]))

#### 2.3 탐색을 위한 데이터 준비: 특징과 라벨 데이터 병합

- Train_X와 Train_Y를 열 기준으로 병합하여 탐색을 위한 데이터를 준비 : Train_df
- 이는 특징에 따른 라벨의 분포를 확인하기 위한 선행 작업임



```python
Train_df = pd.concat([Train_X, Train_Y], axis = 1)
Train_df.head()

#### 2.4 범주형 변수 탐색
##### 탐색 방법
1. 결측을 문자로 변환 (탐색을 위해 임시 변환) <br>
2. 변수별 분포 확인 (bar plot) <br>
3. 변수와 특징 간 관계 확인 (groupby)

##### 탐색 결과 활용
1. 주요 값 기준 이진화
2. 더미화

2.4.1 ProductCD


```python
Train_df['ProductCD'].isnull().sum() # 결측이 전혀없어서, 결측을 문자로 변환할 필요 없음
```




    0




```python
Train_df['ProductCD'].value_counts(normalize = True).plot(kind = 'bar') # value_counts에 대한 bar plot 생성
# ProdudctCD가 W가 매우 높은 비율을 차지하며, S는 1% 가량됨을 확인
```




    <AxesSubplot:>




    
![png](/assets/output_21_1.png)
    



```python
# 상품별로 차이가 존재함을 확인 (다만, H와 W는 거의 유사하다고 판단됨)
# 상태 공간의 크기가 그리 크지 않으니, 굳이 변수 값의 군집화는 수행하지 않고 더미화를 하기로 결정
Train_df.groupby('ProductCD')['isFraud'].mean()
```




    ProductCD
    C    0.088614
    H    0.020413
    R    0.010193
    S    0.025290
    W    0.018609
    Name: isFraud, dtype: float64



2.4.2 card4


```python
Train_df['card4'].isnull().sum() # 결측이 6개밖에 되지 않음 ==> 전부 최빈값으로 대체
```




    6

2.4.4 P_emaildomain과 R_emaildomain

- 이전 탐색에서 각각의 상태 공간 크기가 60, 61임을 확인 (대다수가 gmail 혹은 yahoo 메일임)
- 또한, 결측이 매우 많았는데, email이 결측이라는 것이 어떤 의미가 있을것이라 의심됨
- 샘플의 개수를 고려하더라도 그 크기가 큰 범주형 변수라고 판단 가능
- 두 변수간 관계가 있으리라 쉽게 판단 가능
- 또한, .를 기준으로 앞쪽에는 실제 도메인이, 뒤쪽에는 com, net 등이 포함되어 있어 분할 필요

#### 2.5 연속형 변수 탐색

##### 탐색 방법
1. 변수별 분포 확인 (히스토그램)
2. 변수와 라벨 간 관계 파악 (박스플롯)

##### 탐색 결과 활용
1. 연속형 변수 이진화
2. 변수 치우침 제거

- 선형 관계가 보이지 않는 변수가 대부분이어서 트리 기반의 앙상블 모델을 활용하기로 결정

2.5.1 TransactionAmt


```python
# 히스토그램 생성: 대다수가 1000달러 이하임을 확인 (거기다가 굉장히 치우침을 확인)

```python
# 대다수의 변수가 75%값은 10미만인데, max값은 매우 큼 ==> 이상하다?

## 3. 데이터 전처리

#### 3.1 이진화

- 특정 값을 갖는 변수로 변환하면, 결측값은 자동으로 0을 갖게 되므로 결측 처리를 생략할 수 있음
- card4 이진화 : american express라는 값을 갖는지 여부를 나타내는 특징으로 변환
- card6 이진화 : creidt 이라는 값을 갖는지 여부를 나타내는 특징으로 변환
- NA_R_emaildomain 변수 생성 : R_emaildomain 변수가 결측인지를 나타내는 특징 생성
- same_email 변수 생성 : R_emaildomain 과 P_emaildomain 이 같은지를 나타내는 특징 생성
- C3_over_1 변수 생성 : C3  값이 1보다 크거나 같은지를 나타내는 변수 생성

card4 이진화


```python
Train_X['american_express'] = (Train_X.loc[:, 'card4'] == 'american express').astype(int)
Train_X.drop('card4', axis = 1, inplace = True)
```


```python
Test_X['american_express'] = (Test_X.loc[:, 'card4'] == 'american express').astype(int)
Test_X.drop('card4', axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

card6 이진화


```python
Train_X['credit'] = (Train_X.loc[:, 'card6'] == 'credit').astype(int)
Train_X.drop('card6', axis = 1, inplace = True)
```


```python
Test_X['credit'] = (Test_X.loc[:, 'card6'] == 'credit').astype(int)
Test_X.drop('card6', axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

same_email 변수 추가 및 기존 변수 삭제


```python
Train_X['NA_R_emaildomain'] = (Train_X['R_emaildomain'].isnull()).astype(int)
Train_X['same_emaildomain'] = (Train_X['P_emaildomain'] == Train_X['R_emaildomain']).astype(int)
Train_X.drop(['P_emaildomain', 'R_emaildomain'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```


```python
Test_X['NA_R_emaildomain'] = (Test_X['R_emaildomain'].isnull()).astype(int)
Test_X['same_emaildomain'] = (Test_X['P_emaildomain'] == Test_X['R_emaildomain']).astype(int)
Test_X.drop(['P_emaildomain', 'R_emaildomain'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

C3_over_1 변수 생성


```python
Train_X['C3_over_1'] = (Train_X['C3'] >= 1).astype(int)
Train_X.drop(['C3'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```


```python
Test_X['C3_over_1'] = (Test_X['C3'] >= 1).astype(int)
Test_X.drop(['C3'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

#### 3.2 결측 대체 및 더미화 수행

- 더미화를 수행하기 위해, M1 - M9 변수에 발생한 결측 값을 문자로 치환
- ProductCD 변수와 M1 - M9 변수에 대한 더미화 수행


```python
#!pip install category_encoders
```


```python
from category_encoders import OneHotEncoder as OHE

Train_X[M_columns] = Train_X[M_columns].fillna("결측")
dummy_model = OHE(cols = M_columns + ['ProductCD'], drop_invariant = True).fit(Train_X)
Train_X = dummy_model.transform(Train_X)

Train_X

'''
encoder = OneHotEncoder(use_cat_names=True, cols="Tier")

df_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df)

df_encoded.head(6)
'''
```




    '\nencoder = OneHotEncoder(use_cat_names=True, cols="Tier")\n\ndf_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df)\n\ndf_encoded.head(6)\n'




```python
Train_X.head()
```

#### 3.3 치우침 해소

- 로그 변환을 통해, TransactionAmt에 있는 변수 치우침 해결


```python
Train_X['TransactionAmt'] = np.log(Train_X['TransactionAmt'])
```


```python
Test_X['TransactionAmt'] = np.log(Test_X['TransactionAmt'])
```

#### 3.4 연속형 변수를 이진화

- card3 이라는 변수가 150인지, 185인지를 나타내는 변수 생성
- card5 라는 변수가 226인지를 나타내는 변수 생성


```python
Train_X['card3_150'] = (Train_X['card3'] == 150).astype(int)
Train_X['card3_185'] = (Train_X['card3'] == 185).astype(int)
Train_X['card5_226'] = (Train_X['card5'] == 226).astype(int)

Train_X.drop(['card3', 'card5'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```


```python
Test_X['card3_150'] = (Test_X['card3'] == 150).astype(int)
Test_X['card3_185'] = (Test_X['card3'] == 185).astype(int)
Test_X['card5_226'] = (Test_X['card5'] == 226).astype(int)

Test_X.drop(['card3', 'card5'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

#### 3.5 결측 대체 (주의: 특정 값을 기준으로 이진화하려면 결측 대체가 마지막에 나와야 함!)
- 이진화가 되지 않은 특징에 대한 결측치를 처리하기 위해 Imputer를 사용


```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer as SI
imputer = SI().fit(Train_X)
Train_X = pd.DataFrame(imputer.transform(Train_X), columns = Train_X.columns)
Test_X = pd.DataFrame(imputer.transform(Test_X), columns = Train_X.columns)
```

#### 3.6 클래스 불균형 문제
- 사기 거래 수가 정상 거래에 비해 매우 적으므로, 클래스 불균형 문제가 존재할 가능성이 매우 큼
- 이를 방지하기 위해, 언더샘플링과 비용민감모델을 고려 ( 오버샘플링을 하기에는 샘플이 너무 많음)



```python
# 현재 클래스 간 빈도차이가 매우 심각함을 확인 (97: 3 정도의 비율)
# 전체 샘플 수가 10만개이므로, 오버샘플링을 수행하기에는 부적절
# 언더샘플링을 수행하게 되면 남는 샘플이 약 4천개이며, 특징 수가 그리 많지 않음 ==> 언더샘플링 혹은 비용 민감 모델 고려 필요
```

### 4. 모델 학습
- 사용 모델: Tree 기반의 앙상블 (Random Forest, XGBoost) 
- 언더샘플링과 비용민감모델 동시 고려

모델 파라미터 그리드 설계


```python
#!pip install imblearn
```


```python

# 언더샘플링이 적용되지 않은 데이터에 사용할 그리드 생성
class_imbalance_ratio = sum(Train_Y == 0) / sum(Train_Y == 1)
RF_cs_grid = copy.copy(RF_grid)
RF_cs_grid['class_weight'] = [{1:class_imbalance_ratio * w, 0:1} for w in [1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.5]]

RF_cs_grid = ParameterGrid(RF_cs_grid)
XGB_grid = ParameterGrid(XGB_grid)
XGB_cs_grid = ParameterGrid(XGB_cs_grid)
```


```python
# 최종 그리드 생성 및 모델 테스트 함수 생성
grid_for_cs_model = {RFC:RF_cs_grid, XGB:XGB_cs_grid}
grid_for_not_cs_model = {RFC:RF_grid, XGB:XGB_grid}

from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
def model_test(model, test_x, test_y):
    pred_Y = model.predict(test_x)
    return f1_score(test_y, pred_Y)
```
